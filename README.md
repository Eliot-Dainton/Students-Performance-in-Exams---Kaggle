NN for Kaggle dataset Students Performance in Exams

Dealing with categorical data. Trying to code with Embedding layers for each variable.

Using the Model class instead of Keras API because of having to concatenate different models https://keras.io/api/models/model/

Original approach using this method: https://www.kaggle.com/aquatic/entity-embedding-neural-net/code with a summary https://medium.com/@satnalikamayank12/on-learning-embeddings-for-categorical-data-using-keras-165ff2773fc9

Methods of handling categorical data https://towardsdatascience.com/an-overview-of-categorical-input-handling-for-neural-networks-c172ba552dee

I used a unique number for each category approach, then use embedding.
